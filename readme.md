 # Hero Images


*Hero image functionality is now* available for some components. Currently available the banner and the section whyUrbit.
However, images need to meet some requirements to take full advantage of the functionality and provide a good end-user experience. 

### Normal size

- #### maximum recommended size 800kb
- #### maximum recommended resolution 3000x1848px

### Moblile Size

- #### maximum recommended size 700kb
- #### maximum recommended resolution 854x1183px

It is necessary to remember the contrast that must exist between the background image and the text on it. When a background image is being used, the default color of the text is the one with the secondaryText key, in this case, the chosen image should make a contrast, improving the user's view.
